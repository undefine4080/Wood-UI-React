            Technical Stack Vite React Typescript Less Features 🌴 It's not very
            flatten visual style but textured 🐭 As an ui lib, not very small
            size but less than 1MB currently With the ubiquitous rounded corner

            box, that make me feel comfortable Statement You better don't use
            this lib in your real project, because the quality is unstable 😜
            There are lots of unit test wait to be write, and I will write them

            not build something else even better than AntD 😊 Get It install npm
            i wood-ui-react run the document, first git switch dev and then run
            npm run dev build the production version, first git switch prod and
            then run npm run build
        </div>
